# Chapter 34: Unified GitHub/YAML Workflow Management

The `pmat work` command suite provides a unified workflow management system that seamlessly integrates GitHub Issues with local YAML tracking. This hybrid write-through architecture enables both online and offline work, with automatic synchronization when online.

## Overview

The workflow system supports:
- **GitHub Integration**: Fetch issue metadata from GitHub automatically
- **Offline Mode**: Work entirely in YAML without a GitHub account
- **Hybrid Tracking**: Track both GitHub issues and YAML-only tickets
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detect your GitHub repository from git remote
- **Acceptance Criteria Parsing**: Extract checklists from GitHub issue bodies
- **Specification Generation**: Create linked specification templates
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion percentage across all work items

## Quick Start

### Initialize Your Workflow

```bash
# Auto-detect GitHub repository from git remote
pmat work init

# Or specify repository manually
pmat work init --github-repo owner/repo

# Disable GitHub integration (YAML-only mode)
pmat work init --no-github
```

**Example Output:**
```
🚀 Initializing unified GitHub/YAML workflow...

✅ Created roadmap: ./docs/roadmaps/roadmap.yaml

📋 Configuration:
   GitHub integration: ✅ enabled
   GitHub repository: paiml/pmat

🎯 Next steps:
   1. Create GitHub issue or edit roadmap.yaml
   2. Start work: pmat work start <issue-number-or-ticket-id>
   3. Continue: pmat work continue <id>
   4. Complete: pmat work complete <id>
```

## Core Commands

### `pmat work start`

Start work on a GitHub issue or create a new YAML ticket.

**GitHub Issue (with API Integration):**
```bash
# Fetch GitHub issue #75 metadata
pmat work start 75

# Fetch issue and create specification template
pmat work start 75 --with-spec

# Create GitHub issue from YAML ticket
pmat work start my-feature --create-github
```

**YAML Ticket (Offline Mode):**
```bash
# Create YAML-only ticket
pmat work start implement-caching

# Create with specification template
pmat work start implement-caching --with-spec
```

**Example Output (GitHub Issue):**
```
🚀 Starting work on: 75

📋 Type: GitHub issue #75
   ✅ Fetched from GitHub: Unified GitHub/YAML workflow
   ✅ Extracted 44 acceptance criteria
✅ Updated roadmap: ./docs/roadmaps/roadmap.yaml

🎯 Next steps:
   1. Review specification (if created)
   2. Write failing tests (RED phase)
   3. Implement feature (GREEN phase)
   4. Refactor (REFACTOR phase)
   5. Continue: pmat work continue 75
   6. Complete: pmat work complete 75
```

### `pmat work continue`

Resume work on an existing task with progress display.

```bash
# Continue work on GH-75
pmat work continue GH-75

# Continue YAML ticket
pmat work continue my-feature
```

**Example Output:**
```
🔄 Continuing work on: GH-75

📊 Progress: 50% complete
   Status: InProgress
   Title: Unified GitHub/YAML workflow

🎯 Next steps:
   Continue working on: Unified GitHub/YAML workflow
   When done: pmat work complete GH-75
```

### `pmat work complete`

Mark work as complete with Popperian Falsification quality enforcement.

```bash
# Complete work (runs quality gates + falsification by default)
pmat work complete GH-75

# Skip quality gates (falsification still runs - cannot be skipped)
pmat work complete GH-75 --skip-quality

# Override specific claims with accountability
pmat work complete GH-75 --override-claims coverage,complexity --ticket DEBT-001
```

**Example Output (Passing):**
```
✅ Completing work on: GH-75

🔍 Running quality gates...
✅ All quality gates passed

📜 Loading Work Contract...
   Baseline: a1b2c3d4 (TDG: 78.5, Coverage: 87.2%)

Failures (must fix):
  - [5] Total coverage >= 95%: Coverage dropped from 87.2% to 84.1%
  - [7] No function exceeds complexity 20: 3 functions exceed threshold

Fix issues and retry: pmat work complete GH-75

Or override with accountability (Popperian Protocol):
  1. Create debt ticket: pmat comply upgrade --target popperian
  2. pmat work complete GH-75 --override-claims coverage,complexity --ticket DEBT-001
   📋 Receipt: ./.pmat-work/GH-75/falsification/receipt-2026-02-14T10-30-00Z.json
```

**Example Output (Freshness Skip):**

When a fresh receipt already exists matching the current HEAD commit, falsification is skipped:
```
✅ Completing work on: GH-75

✅ Fresh falsification receipt found (matches HEAD a1b2c3d4)
   Skipping re-run (receipt still valid)

✅ Marked as complete: Unified GitHub/YAML workflow
```

### `pmat work status`

```bash
# Validate default roadmap
pmat work validate

# Validate specific roadmap file
pmat work validate --path ./docs/roadmaps/my-roadmap.yaml
```

**Example Output (Success):**
```
✅ Roadmap validation passed

📋 Summary:
   Total items: 12
   Valid statuses: 12

✅ All status values are valid
```

**Example Output (Errors with Suggestions):**

   planned, todo, open, pending, new
   blocked, stuck, waiting, onhold
   review, reviewing, pr, pendingreview
   cancelled, canceled, dropped, wontfix
```

The validator uses **Levenshtein distance** to suggest the most likely intended status when typos are detected.

### `pmat work migrate`

Migrate legacy status values to the canonical format.

```bash
# Preview migration (dry-run)
pmat work migrate --dry-run

# Apply migration
pmat work migrate

# Migrate specific roadmap
pmat work migrate --path ./docs/roadmaps/my-roadmap.yaml
```

**Example Output (Dry Run):**
```
🔄 Migration preview (dry-run)

📋 Status migrations to apply:

   Item 'GH-75':
     'wip' → 'inprogress'

   Item 'caching-layer':
     'done' → 'completed'

   Item 'auth-system':
     'todo' → 'planned'

📊 Summary: 3 items would be migrated

📋 Migrated statuses:

   Item 'GH-75': wip → inprogress
   Item 'caching-layer': done → completed
   Item 'auth-system': todo → planned

📊 Summary: 3 items migrated
```

### `pmat work list-statuses`

Display all valid status values with their aliases.

```bash
pmat work list-statuses
```

**Output:**
```
📋 Valid Status Values

   completed:
     Primary: completed
     Aliases: done, finished, closed

   inprogress:
     Primary: inprogress
     Aliases: wip, active, started, working

   planned:
     Primary: planned
     Aliases: todo, open, pending, new

   blocked:
     Primary: blocked
     Aliases: stuck, waiting, onhold

   review:
     Primary: review
     Aliases: reviewing, pr, pendingreview

   cancelled:
     Primary: cancelled
     Aliases: canceled, dropped, wontfix

💡 All aliases are normalized on save to their primary form.
```

### `pmat work sync`

Synchronize GitHub and YAML (planned for Phase 6).

```bash
# Full bidirectional sync
pmat work sync --dry-run

# Sync YAML to GitHub
pmat work sync --direction yaml-to-github

# Sync GitHub to YAML
pmat work sync --direction github-to-yaml
```

## GitHub API Integration

### Authentication

The workflow system uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub API access.

**Set your GitHub token:**
```bash
# Personal Access Token (classic)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh auth status  # Verify authenticated
```

**Rate Limits:**
- **Authenticated**: 5,000 requests/hour
- **Unauthenticated**: 60 requests/hour (read-only)

### Fetching Issue Metadata

When you run `pmat work start <issue-number>`, the system:

1. **Fetches Issue Details**: Title, labels, body, state
2. **Parses Acceptance Criteria**: Extracts markdown checklists
3. **Auto-Links to Roadmap**: Creates `GH-<number>` identifier
4. **Updates YAML**: Stores metadata locally

**Example Acceptance Criteria Parsing:**

GitHub Issue Body:
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design YAML schema
- [ ] Implement parser with serde
- [ ] Add GitHub API client
- [x] Write unit tests
```

Roadmap YAML:
```yaml
acceptance_criteria:
  - Design YAML schema
  - Implement parser with serde
  - Add GitHub API client
  - Write unit tests
```

### Error Handling

The system gracefully handles errors:

- **No GITHUB_TOKEN**: Falls back to unauthenticated mode (rate-limited)
- **API Failure**: Creates placeholder, syncs later
- **Network Offline**: Works entirely in YAML mode

## Roadmap YAML Structure

The roadmap is stored in `docs/roadmaps/roadmap.yaml`:

```yaml
roadmap_version: '1.0'
github_enabled: true
github_repo: paiml/pmat
roadmap:
  - id: GH-75
    github_issue: 75
    item_type: task
    title: Unified GitHub/YAML workflow
    status: inprogress
    priority: medium
    assigned_to: null
    created: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z
    updated: 2025-11-19T10:30:00Z
    spec: docs/specifications/075-spec.md
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Design YAML schema
      - Implement parser
    phases: []
    subtasks: []
    estimated_effort: null
    labels:
      - enhancement
      - workflow
```

### Item Status Values

- `planned`: Not yet started (0% progress)
- `inprogress`: Currently being worked on (50% progress)
- `completed`: Finished (100% progress)
- `blocked`: Cannot proceed (0% progress)
- `onhold`: Paused temporarily (previous progress)

### Priority Levels

- `low`: Nice to have
- `medium`: Standard priority
- `high`: Important
- `critical`: Urgent

## Specification Templates

The `--with-spec` flag generates a specification template:

**Filename Convention:**
- GitHub issues: `docs/specifications/075-spec.md`
- YAML tickets: `docs/specifications/feature-name-spec.md`

**Template Structure:**
```markdown
---
title: Feature Name
issue: GH-75
status: In Progress
created: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z
updated: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z

pmat work init
# ✅ Auto-detected: paiml/pmat

# 2. Start work on GitHub issue
pmat work start 75 --with-spec
# ✅ Fetched: "Unified GitHub/YAML workflow"
# ✅ Created: docs/specifications/075-spec.md

# 3. Work on the feature
# ... implement code, write tests ...

# 4. Continue work (shows progress)
pmat work continue GH-75
# 📊 Progress: 50%

# 5. Complete work
pmat work complete GH-75
# ✅ Marked complete
# 🎯 Next: git commit, gh issue close 75
```

### Example 2: YAML-Only Workflow (Offline)

```bash
# 1. Initialize without GitHub
pmat work init --no-github

# 2. Create YAML ticket
pmat work start implement-caching --with-spec
# ✅ Created: YAML ticket
# ✅ Created: docs/specifications/implement-caching-spec.md

# 3. Work on the feature
# ... implement code ...

# 4. Complete work
pmat work complete implement-caching --skip-quality
# ✅ Marked complete (100%)

# 5. View all work
pmat work status
# 📋 1 total: ✅ implement-caching (100%)
```

### Example 3: Hybrid Workflow

# 1. Initialize with GitHub
pmat work init

# 2. Create YAML ticket first
pmat work start add-metrics --with-spec
# ✅ YAML ticket created

# 3. Create GitHub issue from YAML
pmat work start add-metrics --create-github
# 🔄 Creating GitHub issue...
# ✅ Created GitHub issue #123
# ✅ Linked as GH-123

# 4. Continue work
pmat work continue GH-123

# 5. Complete
pmat work complete GH-123
```

## Progress Tracking

The system automatically calculates completion percentage:

### Status-Based Progress
- `planned`: 0%
- `inprogress`: 50%
- `completed`: 100%
- `blocked`: 0%
- `onhold`: Previous progress maintained

### Subtask-Based Progress
When subtasks are defined, progress is calculated from subtask completion:

```yaml
subtasks:
  - name: Write tests
    completion: 100
  - name: Implement feature
    completion: 50
  - name: Add documentation
    completion: 0

# Overall progress: (100 + 50 + 0) / 3 = 50%
```

### Phase-Based Progress
When phases are defined, progress is averaged across phases:

```yaml
phases:
  - name: Foundation
    completion: 100
  - name: Core Implementation
    completion: 50

# Overall progress: (100 + 50) / 2 = 75%
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Initialize Early
Run `pmat work init` at the start of your project to enable tracking from the beginning.

### 2. Use Specifications
Always use `--with-spec` for non-trivial features to document your design.

### 3. Track Progress
Regularly run `pmat work status` to monitor progress across all work items.

### 4. Commit References
Include work item references in commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add caching layer (Refs GH-123)"
```

### 5. Close Issues
After completing work on a GitHub issue, close it:
```bash
gh issue close 123  # Or via GitHub web UI
```

### 6. Sync Regularly
When working with GitHub, sync frequently to avoid conflicts:
```bash
pmat work sync --dry-run  # Preview changes
pmat work sync             # Apply sync
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Token Not Found

**Error:**
```
GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable not set
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set token (Personal Access Token)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

### Issue Not Found

**Error:**
```
Failed to fetch issue #999
```

**Causes:**
- Issue number doesn't exist
- Issue is in a different repository
- No access to private repository

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify issue exists
gh issue view 999

# Check repository configuration
cat docs/roadmaps/roadmap.yaml | grep github_repo
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded

**Error:**
```
API rate limit exceeded
```

**Solution:**
- Wait for rate limit reset (1 hour)
- Use authenticated requests (set GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Reduce API calls (use offline mode)

### Roadmap Not Found

**Error:**
```
Failed to load roadmap. Run `pmat work init` first.
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Initialize workflow
pmat work init
```

## Integration with EXTREME TDD

The workflow system integrates seamlessly with PMAT's EXTREME TDD methodology:

### RED Phase: Start Work
```bash
pmat work start feature-name --with-spec
# ✅ Specification created
# Now write failing tests
```

### GREEN Phase: Implement
```bash
pmat work continue feature-name
# 📊 Progress: 50%
# Implement feature to make tests pass
```

### REFACTOR Phase: Complete
```bash
pmat work complete feature-name
# ✅ Runs quality gates
# ✅ Ensures test coverage ≥85%
# ✅ Checks clippy warnings
```

## Multi-Agent Concurrency Safety

**Version**: Added in PMAT v2.201.0
**Technology**: Cross-platform file locking via `fs2` crate

The workflow system implements production-grade concurrency safety to support multiple AI sub-agents working simultaneously on the same roadmap. This is essential for agentic workflows where several agents may be updating work items concurrently.

### The Problem: Race Conditions

Without file locking, concurrent writes cause data loss:

```
Agent A: Load roadmap (2 items)
Agent B: Load roadmap (2 items)      ← Same data
Agent A: Add item C (3 items)
Agent B: Add item D (3 items)        ← Different item
Agent A: Save roadmap (items: A, B, C)
Agent B: Save roadmap (items: A, B, D)  ← OVERWRITES Agent A's work!
Result: Item C is LOST ❌
```

### The Solution: Atomic Operations with File Locking

PMAT uses the `fs2` crate for cross-platform file locking:

**Lock File**: `roadmap.yaml.lock` (created automatically alongside `roadmap.yaml`)

**Lock Types**:
- **Shared Locks** (Read operations): Multiple concurrent readers allowed
  - `load()`, `find_item()`, `status` commands
- **Exclusive Locks** (Write operations): Blocks all other readers and writers
  - `save()`, `upsert_item()`, `start`, `continue`, `complete` commands

**Atomic Read-Modify-Write**:
```
Agent A: Acquire EXCLUSIVE lock 🔒
Agent A: Load roadmap (2 items)
Agent B: Try to acquire lock → WAITS ⏳
Agent A: Add item C (3 items)
Agent A: Save roadmap
Agent A: Release lock 🔓
Agent B: Acquire lock ✅
Agent B: Load roadmap (3 items)    ← Sees Agent A's changes
Agent B: Add item D (4 items)
Agent B: Save roadmap
Agent B: Release lock 🔓
Result: Both items preserved ✅
```

### Concurrency Guarantees

✅ **Zero Data Loss**: All concurrent writes succeed, no overwrites
✅ **Cross-Process Safety**: Works across multiple `pmat` processes
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows via `fs2` crate
✅ **Deadlock-Free**: RAII pattern ensures locks always released
✅ **Graceful Blocking**: Agents wait for lock, don't fail

### Performance Characteristics

**Lock Contention**: Sequential bottleneck by design
- **Write time**: ~1-5ms (YAML serialize + disk write)
- **10 agents**: ~50ms total (sequential, not parallel)
- **Trade-off**: Correctness > Performance (appropriate for CLI tool)

**Read Performance**: Concurrent reads have no contention (shared locks)

### Testing Validation

The concurrent safety is validated with comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test 10 threads writing simultaneously
cargo test test_concurrent_operations

# Result: ✅ All 10 items present (no overwrites)
```

**Test Code** (`server/src/services/roadmap_service.rs`):
```rust
#[test]
fn test_concurrent_operations() {
    // Spawn 10 threads writing simultaneously
    for i in 0..10 {
        thread::spawn(|| {
            service.upsert_item(item_i).unwrap();
        });
    }

    // ✅ All 10 items present
    assert_eq!(roadmap.roadmap.len(), 10);
}
```

### Automatic and Transparent

**No user action required**:
- File locking happens automatically
- Lock files are created/cleaned up automatically
- Agents seamlessly coordinate via filesystem

**Typical Usage** (unchanged):
```bash
# Agent 1
pmat work start feature-a

# Agent 2 (simultaneously)
pmat work start feature-b

# Both succeed, no conflicts ✅
```

### When Locks Are Held

**Read Operations** (Shared Lock):
- `pmat work status` - Very brief (< 1ms)
- `pmat work continue` - Very brief (< 1ms)

**Write Operations** (Exclusive Lock):
- `pmat work start` - Brief (~1-5ms)
- `pmat work complete` - Brief (~1-5ms)

**Lock Duration**: Microseconds to milliseconds - users won't notice blocking

### Implementation Details

**Lock File Management**:
- Lock file: `docs/roadmaps/roadmap.yaml.lock`
- Created automatically on first use
- Never manually deleted (safe to leave)
- Size: 0 bytes (empty file, only used for locking)

**RAII Pattern**:
```rust
fn upsert_item(&self, item: RoadmapItem) -> Result<()> {
    let _lock = self.acquire_write_lock()?;  // 🔒 Lock acquired

    // ... read, modify, write ...

    Ok(())
    // 🔓 Lock automatically released when _lock drops
}
```

### Comparison with Other Approaches

| Approach | Data Safety | Performance | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **No Locking** | ❌ Data loss | ⚡ Fast | ✅ Simple |
| **Optimistic Locking** | ⚠️ Retry needed | ⚡ Fast | ⚠️ Medium |
| **File Locking (PMAT)** | ✅ Guaranteed | ✅ Adequate | ✅ Simple |
| **Database** | ✅ Guaranteed | ⚡ Fast | ❌ Complex |

**Why File Locking**: Best balance of safety, simplicity, and performance for a CLI tool.

### Multi-Agent Workflow Example

**Scenario**: 5 AI sub-agents working on different features simultaneously

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Agent working on authentication
pmat work start auth-system --with-spec
# 🔒 Lock acquired, item created, lock released

# Terminal 2 - Agent working on database (simultaneous)
pmat work start database-layer --with-spec
# ⏳ Waits for Terminal 1's lock
# 🔒 Lock acquired, item created, lock released

# Terminal 3 - Agent checking status (simultaneous)
pmat work status
# 🔒 Shared lock acquired (doesn't block)
# 📋 Shows: auth-system, database-layer
# 🔓 Shared lock released

# Terminal 4 & 5 - More agents (simultaneous)
pmat work start api-endpoints --with-spec
pmat work start testing-framework --with-spec

# Result: ✅ All 5 items created successfully, no data loss
```

### Future Enhancements (Planned)

### Pre-commit Hooks (Phase 6)
Automatically validate commit messages reference work items:
```bash
# Valid
git commit -m "feat: Add feature (Refs GH-75)"

# Invalid (blocked by hook)
git commit -m "Add feature"
```

### CHANGELOG Auto-Update (Phase 7)
Automatically update CHANGELOG.md from issue labels:
```bash
pmat work complete GH-75
# ✅ Added to CHANGELOG.md:
#    ## [Unreleased]
#    ### Added
#    - Unified GitHub/YAML workflow (#75)
```

### Quality Gates Integration (Phase 8) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Run quality gates before completion:
```bash
pmat work complete GH-75
# 🔄 Running quality gates...
# ✅ Tests passing
# ✅ Coverage ≥85%
# ✅ Zero clippy warnings
# ✅ Marked complete
```

## Work Contract and Popperian Falsification

**Version**: Added in PMAT v2.214.0

The Work Contract system implements evidence-based quality enforcement using Popperian falsification epistemology. Every claim must be falsifiable—if falsification finds evidence of regression, work is BLOCKED.

### Core Philosophy

Karl Popper's falsificationism applied to software quality:

> **"A claim is scientific only if it can be proven false."**

In PMAT:
- Every quality claim must have a falsification test
- If the test finds counter-evidence, the claim is FALSIFIED
- FALSIFIED claims BLOCK completion (unless overridden with accountability)
- The falsifier itself is tested (meta-falsification)

### Work Contract Lifecycle

### The 17 Falsifiable Claims

| # | Claim | Falsification Test | Severity |
|---|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Manifest Integrity** | No baseline files deleted | BLOCKING |
| 2 | **Meta-Falsification** | Falsifier detects injected faults | BLOCKING |
| 3 | **Coverage Gaming** | No `cfg(not(coverage))` or LCOV exclusions | BLOCKING |
| 4 | **Differential Coverage** | All new/changed lines tested | BLOCKING |
| 5 | **Absolute Coverage** | Coverage ≥ 95% | BLOCKING |
| 6 | **TDG Regression** | TDG score ≥ baseline | BLOCKING |
| 7 | **Complexity** | No function > 20 cyclomatic | BLOCKING |
| 8 | **Supply Chain** | `cargo deny check` passes | BLOCKING |
| 9 | **File Size** | No file > 500 lines | WARNING |
| 10 | **Spec Quality** | Specification score ≥ threshold | BLOCKING |
| 11 | **Roadmap Update** | Roadmap modified since baseline | BLOCKING |
| 12 | **GitHub Sync** | No uncommitted/unpushed changes | BLOCKING |
| 13 | **Examples Compile** | `cargo build --examples` passes | BLOCKING |
| 14 | **Book Validation** | pmat-book tests pass | BLOCKING |
| 15 | **SATD Detection** | No new TODO/FIXME/HACK markers | Configurable |
| 16 | **Dead Code Detection** | No new unreachable code | Configurable |
| 17 | **Per-File Coverage** | All files ≥ 95% coverage | BLOCKING |
| 18 | **Lint Pass** | `make lint` passes | Configurable |

### Anti-Gaming Detection

The system detects attempts to game coverage metrics:

**Detected Patterns:**
- `#[cfg(not(coverage))]` - Code excluded from coverage
- `#[cfg(not(tarpaulin))]` - Tarpaulin-specific exclusion
- `// LCOV_EXCL_START` / `// LCOV_EXCL_STOP` - LCOV exclusion markers
- Test file deletions from baseline

**Example Detection:**
```
[3/13] No coverage exclusion gaming
      Falsification: Scanning for gaming patterns...
      Result: FAILED
      Evidence: Found cfg(not(coverage)) in src/services/cache.rs:45
```

### Accountable Overrides

Overrides require accountability—you cannot bypass falsification silently:

**BLOCKED (no accountability):**
```bash
pmat work complete GH-75 --override-claims coverage
# Error: --ticket is mandatory for overrides.
#
# Popperian Principle: Every override must be accountable.
# Create a debt ticket first:
# 1. pmat comply upgrade --target popperian
# 2. Or manually create .pmat-tickets/DEBT-XXX.yaml
```

**ALLOWED (with ticket):**
```bash
pmat work complete GH-75 --override-claims coverage,complexity --ticket DEBT-COV-20250125
# ⚠️  FALSIFICATION RESULT: OVERRIDDEN (2 claim(s) overridden with ticket DEBT-COV-20250125)
#
# Overridden claims:
#   - [5] Total coverage >= 95%: Coverage at 82.3% (OVERRIDDEN)
#   - [7] No function exceeds complexity 20: 2 functions (OVERRIDDEN)
#
# ⚠️  WARNING: Technical debt incurred. Track with ticket: DEBT-COV-20250125
```

### Valid Override Claim Names

Use these names with `--override-claims`:

| Name | Claim |
|------|-------|
| `manifest` | Manifest integrity |
| `meta-falsification` | Meta-falsification |
| `coverage-gaming` | Coverage gaming detection |
| `differential-coverage` | Differential coverage |
| `coverage` | Absolute coverage |
| `tdg` | TDG regression |
| `complexity` | Complexity limits |
| `supply-chain` | Supply chain integrity |
| `file-size` | File size limits |
| `spec-quality` | Specification quality |
| `github-sync` | GitHub sync status |
| `examples` | Examples compilation |
| `book` | Book validation |
| `satd` | SATD marker detection |
| `dead-code` | Dead code detection |
| `per-file-coverage` | Per-file coverage threshold |
| `lint` | Lint pass |

### Contract Storage

Work contracts are stored in `.pmat-work/<ticket-id>/contract.json`:

```json
{
  "ticket_id": "GH-75",
  "baseline_commit": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "baseline_tdg": 78.5,
  "baseline_coverage": 87.2,
  "baseline_rust_score": 92.0,
  "baseline_file_manifest": {
    "files": ["src/lib.rs", "src/main.rs", ...],
    "coverage_required": ["src/lib.rs", "src/services/..."]
  },
  "claims": [...],
  "created_at": "2025-01-25T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Falsification Ledger

**Version**: Added in PMAT v3.0.7

Every falsification run produces an immutable **receipt** that records what was tested, what passed/failed, and any overrides. Receipts are persisted per-item and appended to a global JSONL ledger for audit trails.

**Storage Layout:**
```
.pmat-work/
├── {item-id}/
│   ├── contract.json              # Baseline contract
│   └── falsification/             # Receipt directory
│       ├── receipt-2026-02-14T10-28-50Z.json
│       └── receipt-2026-02-14T10-29-28Z.json
└── ledger.jsonl                   # Global append-only audit log
```

**Receipt Contents:**
```json
{
  "id": "019c5bb2-30c2-76f3-8f7b-cb8c391c049f",
  "git_sha": "6b7d70606f98...",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-14T10:28:50+00:00",
  "trigger": "WorkComplete",
  "work_item_id": "PMAT-499",
  "verdicts": [
    {
      "hypothesis": "All baseline files still exist",
      "method": "ManifestIntegrity",
      "falsified": false,
      "is_blocking": true,
      "explanation": "All 2128 files present"
    }
  ],
  "overrides": [],
  "summary": {
    "total": 17, "passed": 11, "failed": 5,
    "warnings": 1, "overridden": 0,
    "allows_completion": false,
    "health_score": 0.647
  },
  "content_hash": "4d57ddb1634d..."
}
```

**Key Properties:**
- **UUID v7** IDs (time-sortable) for chronological ordering
- **SHA-256 content hash** covers all fields — tamper-detectable
- **Freshness check**: Receipts are valid only when `git_sha` matches HEAD and age < 24 hours
- **O(1) skip**: If a fresh passing receipt exists, `pmat work complete` skips re-running falsification
- **Global ledger**: Compact JSONL entries for cross-project audit, one line per run

**Trigger Types:**
| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `WorkComplete` | `pmat work complete` |
| `ManualCli` | Manual CLI invocation |
| `CiPipeline` | CI/CD pipeline |
| `McpTool` | MCP tool call |
| `PreCommit` | Pre-commit hook |

**Integrity Verification:**

The ledger supports integrity verification to detect tampered receipts:
```bash
# Receipts are verified automatically on load
# Tampered receipts (modified git_sha, verdicts, etc.) are detected
# via SHA-256 content hash mismatch
```

### --skip-quality vs Falsification

**Important**: `--skip-quality` skips quality gates (clippy, tests), but falsification ALWAYS runs:

```bash
pmat work complete GH-75 --skip-quality
# ⚠️  Quality gates SKIPPED (--skip-quality)
#
# 📜 Loading Work Contract...
# Running Popperian Falsification (13 claims to validate)
# ... falsification runs regardless ...
```

This ensures you can skip slow quality gates during development, but cannot bypass the evidence-based falsification system.

### Epic Support (Phase 9)
Track epics with subtasks:
```bash
pmat work start 100 --epic
# ✅ Created epic: GH-100
# 📋 Subtasks:
#    - GH-101: Design
#    - GH-102: Implementation
#    - GH-103: Testing
```

## Specification Quality Assurance

### `pmat qa spec`

Validate specification documents with a 100-point Popperian falsifiability scoring system. This ensures specifications follow scientific standards for verifiable, testable claims.

```bash
# Validate a specification file
pmat qa spec enhance-pmat-work

# Full validation with detailed output
pmat qa spec enhance-pmat-work --full

# JSON output for CI/CD
pmat qa spec enhance-pmat-work --format json --output qa-report.json

# Custom threshold (default: 60)
pmat qa spec enhance-pmat-work --threshold 80
```

**Aliases:** `spec`, `popper`

### 100-Point Popperian Scoring Framework

The scoring system evaluates specifications across 5 categories:

| Category | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Falsifiability** | 25 | Testable claims that can be proven false |
| **Implementation** | 25 | Concrete, executable requirements |
| **Testing** | 20 | Comprehensive test coverage |
| **Documentation** | 15 | Clear explanations and examples |
| **Integration** | 15 | External system considerations |

### Gateway Check: Falsifiability

**CRITICAL**: The Falsifiability category serves as a **gateway check**:

- If Falsifiability score < 60% (15 pts), **total score = 0**
- This enforces scientific standards—specifications must be testable

**Example Gateway Failure:**
```
❌ Specification QA: FAIL

📊 Popperian Quality Score: 0/100 (F)

⚠️  GATEWAY CHECK FAILED
    Falsifiability score: 40% (10/25 pts)
    Required: ≥60% (15 pts)

    Specifications must contain testable, falsifiable claims.
    Claims that cannot be proven false are not scientific.

📋 Category Breakdown:
   Falsifiability:   10/25 pts (40%) ❌ GATEWAY FAIL
   Implementation:   20/25 pts (80%) ✓
   Testing:          15/20 pts (75%) ✓
   Documentation:    12/15 pts (80%) ✓
   Integration:      10/15 pts (67%) ✓

💡 Recommendations:
   1. Add testable acceptance criteria with specific metrics
   2. Include falsifiable claims like "Response time < 100ms"
   3. Remove vague claims like "should be fast"
```

### Example Output (Passing)

```
✅ Specification QA: PASS

📊 Popperian Quality Score: 87/100 (A)

📋 Category Breakdown:
   Falsifiability:   22/25 pts (88%) ✓ GATEWAY PASSED
   Implementation:   23/25 pts (92%) ✓

   Documentation:    13/15 pts (87%) ✓
   Integration:      11/15 pts (73%) ✓

📈 Claim Analysis:
   Total claims: 47
   Validated: 42 (89%)
   Code examples: 12
   Acceptance criteria: 23

✅ Specification meets Popperian quality standards
```

### Popperian Principles Applied

The scoring system applies Karl Popper's philosophy of science:

1. **Falsifiability**: A claim is scientific only if it can be proven false
   - ✅ "Response time must be < 100ms" (testable)
   - ❌ "Should be performant" (unfalsifiable)

2. **Specificity**: Concrete, measurable criteria
   - ✅ "Coverage must be ≥85%" (specific)
   - ❌ "Should have good coverage" (vague)

3. **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in observable facts
   - ✅ "Uses serde for parsing" (verifiable)
   - ❌ "Best-in-class implementation" (subjective)

### Claim Categories

The parser extracts and categorizes claims from specifications:

| Category | Example Claims |
|----------|---------------|
| **Falsifiability** | "Test coverage must be ≥85%", "Response < 100ms" |
| **Implementation** | "Uses serde for YAML parsing", "Implements trait X" |
| **Testing** | "Includes unit tests for all functions" |
| **Documentation** | "API documented with rustdoc" |
| **Integration** | "Integrates with GitHub API" |

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/qa.yml
- name: Validate Specification Quality
  run: |
    pmat qa spec my-feature --format json --output qa.json
    SCORE=$(jq '.total_score' qa.json)
    if (( $(echo "$SCORE < 70" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "Specification score $SCORE below threshold"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## 200-Point Perfection Score

**Version**: Added in PMAT v2.211.1 (master-plan-pmat-work-system.md)

The Perfection Score aggregates 8 quality metrics into a unified 200-point scale, providing a single "project health" number that answers: "Is this codebase ready for production?"

### Quick Start

```bash
# Fast mode (default) - real metrics in ~30 seconds
pmat perfection-score --fast --breakdown

# Full analysis mode
pmat perfection-score --breakdown

# Target a specific score
pmat perfection-score --target 180
```

### 200-Point Category Breakdown

| Category | Max Points | Weight | Description |
|----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **TDG (Technical Debt Grade)** | 40 | 20% | Code quality and debt metrics |
| **Repository Health** | 30 | 15% | Repo hygiene (CI, docs, hooks) |
| **Rust Project Score** | 30 | 15% | Rust-specific quality (clippy, fmt) |
| **Popperian Falsifiability** | 25 | 12.5% | Specification testability |
| **Test Coverage** | 25 | 12.5% | Line and branch coverage |
| **Mutation Testing** | 20 | 10% | Test effectiveness |

💡 Recommendations
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  🟡 Repository Health needs attention (73%)
  🟡 Mutation Testing needs attention (70%)
  🟡 Performance needs attention (68%)
```

### Integration with Work Commands

The Perfection Score integrates with the workflow system:

```bash
# Complete work only if perfection score meets threshold
pmat work complete feature-123 --min-perfection 160

# Enforce minimum perfection score via git hooks
pmat comply enforce --min-perfection 140
```

### Fast vs Full Mode

**Fast Mode** (default, `--fast`):
- Time: ~30 seconds
- Skips: Mutation testing (expensive), full clippy analysis
- Uses: Cached metrics from `.pmat-metrics/`
- Best for: CI checks, development feedback

**Full Mode**:
- Time: ~5-15 minutes (project dependent)
- Runs: All checks comprehensively
- Best for: Release validation, comprehensive audits

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality.yml
- name: Check Perfection Score
  run: |
    pmat perfection-score --fast --format json --output score.json
    SCORE=$(jq '.total_score' score.json)
    GRADE=$(jq -r '.grade' score.json)
    echo "Score: $SCORE ($GRADE)"
    if (( $(echo "$SCORE < 140" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "::error::Perfection score $SCORE below B threshold"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Specification Management Commands

**Version**: Added in PMAT v2.211.1

Manage specification files with Popperian quality validation:

```bash
# Score a specification (95-point threshold)
pmat spec score docs/specifications/my-spec.md --verbose

pmat spec comply docs/specifications/my-spec.md --dry-run
pmat spec comply docs/specifications/my-spec.md

# Create new specification from template
pmat spec create "My Feature" --issue "#123" --epic "PMAT-001"

# List all specifications with scores
pmat spec list docs/specifications/ --failing-only
```

### Spec Score Requirements (95-point minimum)
