## Optimizing Code Performance with PMAT

PMAT's performance analysis identifies bottlenecks, suggests optimizations, and tracks performance trends over time. It analyzes algorithmic complexity, memory usage patterns, and execution hotspots across your entire codebase.

## Performance Analysis Features

- **Algorithm Complexity Detection**: Identify O(n¬≤) loops and inefficient patterns
- **Memory Usage Analysis**: Find memory leaks and excessive allocations
- **Hotspot Detection**: Locate performance-critical code paths
- **Benchmark Integration**: Automated performance regression testing
- **Optimization Suggestions**: AI-powered performance improvements

## Quick Performance Scan

```bash
# Basic performance analysis
pmat performance analyze .

# Focus on performance-critical files
pmat performance analyze --hot-paths-only

# Generate performance report
pmat performance report --format=html --output=perf-report.html
```

## Configuration

```toml
# pmat.toml
[performance]
enabled = true
analyze_complexity = true
memory_analysis = true
hotspot_detection = true

[performance.thresholds]
max_complexity = "O(n¬≤)"
max_memory_mb = 100
max_execution_time_ms = 1000

[performance.analysis]
include_benchmarks = true
profile_hot_paths = true
suggest_optimizations = true

[performance.reporting]
include_visualizations = true
compare_with_baseline = true
highlight_regressions = true
```

## Algorithmic Complexity Analysis

### Detecting Inefficient Loops

```python
# BEFORE: O(n¬≤) complexity detected
def find_duplicates(items):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(items)):
            if items[i] == items[j]:
                duplicates.append(items[i])
    return duplicates

# AFTER: O(n) optimized version
def find_duplicates_optimized(items):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    for item in items:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        else:
            seen.add(item)
    return list(duplicates)
```

### Memory Usage Optimization

```python
# BEFORE: Memory inefficient
def process_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        data = f.read()  # Loads entire file into memory
    
    results = []
    for line in data.split('\n'):
        if process_line(line):
            results.append(transform_line(line))
    
    return results

# AFTER: Memory efficient
def process_large_file_optimized(filename):
    def process_lines():
        with open(filename) as f:
            for line in f:  # Streams line by line
                processed = process_line(line.strip())
                if processed:
                    yield transform_line(processed)
    
    return list(process_lines())
```

## Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Performance Optimization

```bash
pmat performance analyze ecommerce-platform/ \
  --focus="order_processing,payment_handling,search" \
  --benchmark-critical-paths
```

**Results:**
```
‚ö° Performance Analysis: E-commerce Platform

üî• Critical Performance Issues:
  1. search/product_search.py:45 - O(n¬≤) algorithm in hot path
     Impact: 2.3s response time for 1000+ products
     Fix: Implement search index or database optimization
     
  2. payment/processor.py:123 - Synchronous external API calls
     Impact: 850ms average response time
     Fix: Use async/await for concurrent API calls
     
  3. order/calculations.py:67 - Repeated database queries in loop
     Impact: N+1 query problem (50+ queries per order)
     Fix: Use bulk queries or eager loading

üìä Performance Metrics:
  - Total hotspots identified: 15
  - Average response time improvement potential: 67%
  - Memory usage reduction potential: 45%
  - Critical path bottlenecks: 3
