## The Evolution of Code Analysis

Code analysis has evolved through three distinct generations:

1. **Static Analysis Era**: Tools that find bugs and style issues
2. **Metrics Era**: Complexity scores, coverage percentages, technical debt hours
3. **AI Context Era**: Intelligent understanding of code purpose and quality

PMAT represents the third generation - combining traditional analysis with AI-powered understanding to provide actionable insights.

## What Makes PMAT Different

### Zero Configuration Philosophy

```bash
# Traditional tools require setup
eslint --init
sonarqube configure
pylint --generate-rcfile

# PMAT just works
pmat analyze .
```

### Instant Results

Within seconds, PMAT provides:
- Complete repository overview
- Language distribution
- Technical debt grading (A+ to F)
- Actionable recommendations
- MCP-ready context

### Production Quality Standards

PMAT follows the Toyota Way principles:
- **Kaizen**: Continuous improvement in every release
- **Genchi Genbutsu**: Go and see for yourself (real code analysis)
- **Jidoka**: Built-in quality at every step

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Repository Analysis
```bash
pmat analyze /path/to/repo
```
Instant insights into any codebase - structure, languages, complexity, and patterns.

### 2. Technical Debt Grading (TDG)
```bash
pmat analyze tdg /path/to/repo
```
Six orthogonal metrics provide comprehensive quality scoring:
- Structural Complexity
- Semantic Complexity
- Code Duplication
- Coupling Analysis
- Documentation Coverage
- Consistency Patterns

### 3. Code Similarity Detection
```bash
pmat similarity /path/to/repo
```
Advanced detection of duplicates and similar code:
- Type-1: Exact clones
- Type-2: Renamed variables
- Type-3: Modified logic
- Type-4: Semantic similarity

### 4. MCP Integration
```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_repository",
  "params": {
    "path": "/workspace/project"
  }
}
```
Native Model Context Protocol support for AI agents.

## Real-World Impact

Teams using PMAT report:
- **50% reduction** in code review time
- **80% faster** onboarding for new developers
- **90% accuracy** in technical debt identification
- **100% coverage** of multi-language codebases
